# Prerequisites:
Install `bash-completion` and `sed` before install

# Installation:
Run `make all` to install the `.bashrc` file and the `.inputrc` file. If you
do not wish to install both use the `make load_bash` or `make load_inputrc`
files to load which you want. NOTE: It may be desired to also run `make clean`
afterward if not running `make all` to remove undesired tmp files.

# Usage:
Close current terminal and reopen to get all the features desired.
